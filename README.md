## Requirements
In this assignment you will be creating a website using HTML and CSS.
You are required to create one of the following:
1. A personal website
2. A website for a charity or community organisation of your choice.


The website should have five pages including: a homepage (index.html), a gallery page (e.g. page displaying images), and three pages of your own choice.

You should ensure that your HTML and CSS code is valid and should make appropriate use of HTML and CSS to separate the content and presentation (styling) of the site.

Alongside these general requirements, your website should include the following:

    § Links to both your own pages and external webpages.

    § A navigation bar

    § At least one table

    § At least one list (ordered or unordered)

    § At least one local or embedded video

    § At least four CSS3 and four HTML5 elements

    § Make use of the CSS positional properties (e.g. position, float)

    § Make use of both inline and block elements


## Implementation of requirements:

1. A personal website is created.

2. The website has five pages including:

    § a homepage: index.html

    § a simple gallery page: pics.html

    § a page about the computer science / the course: cs.html

    § a page with a CV embedded in pdf: cv.html

    § a page with FAQ: informal.html

3. Valid HTML and CSS code has been used with styling as much as possible seperated from the site.

4. Links to all pages have been provided. An external link is created in the profile status on the left (Computer Science Convert @ UCD).

5. A navigation bar is included on all pages.

6. A table is included on cs.html

7. Lists have been used on every left sidebar and also on the homepage.
The list has been configured on purpose to display no icons, bullets or numbers.

8. 4 YouTube video's have been embedded. 3 on index.html and 1 on informal.html.

9. 
HTML 5 properties:

    § meta charset="UTF-8" element on all html pages

    § footer element on all pages

    § main element on almost all pages except cv.html

    § details element on informal.html page

CSS3 properties:

    § column-span : used in table on cs.html

    § text-decoration:overline; used in heading h2

    § text-decoration-color: used in same heading h2

    § text-decoration-style: dotted; used in same heading h2

    § z-index:  1 and 2 in CSS in .user-profile-name-box and .user-profile-picture

10. Positional properties have been used throughout. The nicest example is the relative vs
absolute positioning to display the user name box in front of the profile picture on the left.

11. Block elements are widely used and a nice example of an inline element is used in the 'Gadgets' heading on the right.
Coloring only the letters ads, shows that Gadgets is a semi-advertising block for personal promotions.

## Additional features (d):

*The stylesheet explores with responsive layouts. It is opportune to develop this further to make everything align well.

*The style sheet includes the CSS Grid. Which is an advanced and efficient way to work with lay out.

*The CSS sheet explores the SMACSS structure: Scalable and Modular Architecture forCSS. For more info: https://smacss.com/

*A PDF file has been embedded.

## Code Validation:

HTML validator shows:

>iframe/video's: The frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.

>profile-image: Bad value 100% for attribute width on element img: Expected a digit but saw % instead.

>pdf embed: Bad value 100% for attribute width on element embed: Expected a digit but saw % instead.

>Duplicate ID left; This occurs in the table at cs.html. However, these are added to color the left header.
It could be done more elegant with colomn colors in future.

Above errors are minor and chosen is to leave these as is, taking into account the scope of the project.

## CSS Validations shows:

No errors.

## Commenting
Excessive commenting is used to support beginners coding and show of understanding.
